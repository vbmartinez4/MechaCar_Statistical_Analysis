# MechaCar Statistical Analysis
## Overview
We have been hired by Jeremy and his data analytics team to produce an in-depth statistical review of AutosRUs’ newest prototype, the MechaCar. The car is suffering from production troubles, which in return, is hindering the manufacturing team’s ability to progress with the R&D of the prototype. We will be investigating the production data provided to us by upper management to review, analyze, and provide our findings to the manufacturing team that can help them in the development process.

## Tools Used:
- R

## Dataset:
- 50 MechaCar Prototypes: MechaCar_mpg.csv
- Production Lot Results: Suspension_Coil.csv

## Objectives:
- Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes
- Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots
- Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population
- Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. For each statistical analysis, you’ll write a summary interpretation of the findings.
