# MechaCar Statistical Analysis
## Overview
We have been hired by Jeremy and his data analytics team to produce an in-depth statistical review of AutosRUs’ newest prototype, the MechaCar. The car is suffering from production troubles, which in return, is hindering the manufacturing team’s ability to progress with the R&D of the prototype. We will be investigating the production data provided to us by upper management to review, analyze, and provide our findings to the manufacturing team that can help them in the development process.
